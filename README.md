# NYC Taxi Data
## Research questions
 To better understand the dynamics of taxi vehicles in New York City I try to explore the data to answer few of the following questions:
 1. Understand the relation between trip distance and counts(are people more prone to book cabs for shorter or longer trips??)
 2. How often do people ride to/fro from the 3 airports? What is the average time for a trip to/from each of these airports?
 3. How do airport trips differ from general trips with respect to:
    1. Trip count
    2. Fare Amounts
    3. Trip Distance
    4. Tip amounts
4. Can we build a model to predict the tip using features like pickup/drop-off locations, trip time, passenger count, average speed, etc?
5. Can we drop some features if we see that they do not contribute as much to the model?
